Players take turns rolling a six-sided die and move their tokens forward.
Snakes and Ladders on the board can either help or hinder a player's progress.
The first player to reach the last square is the winner.
Game Rules
Players start at square 1 and move forward based on dice rolls.
If a player lands on a square with the bottom of a ladder, they move to the top of the ladder.
If a player lands on a square with the head of a snake, they move to the tail of the snake.
The game continues until a player reaches the last square.
